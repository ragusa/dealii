    <h1>Installing deal.II with CUDA</h1>                  

    <p>
      To compile and run CUDA code, you need a CUDA-enabled GPU, appropriate
      drivers, the CUDA toolkit, and the nvcc compiler. Unlike other libraries,
      you need special hardware and compiler to enable CUDA. Because the
      hardware is always evolving, older GPUs do not support all the
      capabilities of newer ones. In order to use CUDA with deal.II, you will
      need your GPU to have compute capability 3.5 or higher. Independently
      from the GPU itself, you also need a version of CUDA recent enough.
      deal.II supports CUDA 8.0 and higher. Finally to be able to configure
      deal.II, you will need CMake 3.9 or higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      To configure deal.II with CUDA use the following option:
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_WITH_CUDA=ON
      </pre>
      Depending on you system, this may be enough to get CUDA to work. If you
      are using CUDA 8 with gcc 5.4, you will need to turn off support for
      C++14:
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_WITH_CXX14=OFF
      </pre>
      If you are using CUDA 9 or CUDA 10, you will need to turn off support for
      C++17 similarly.
      By default, we assume that your GPU has compute capability 3.5 but you 
      can easily set your own CUDA flags:
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_CUDA_FLAGS="-arch=sm_60"
      </pre>
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CUDA_FLAGS_DEBUG</code> and 
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CUDA_FLAGS_RELEASE</code> are also available if you want
      a finer control on the CUDA flags. The CUDA compiler and the
      CUDA toolkit root directory can be set using 
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CUDA_COMPILER</code> and 
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR</code>.
      Finally, the CUDA host compiler is the same as the C++ compiler
      by default, but can be changed using CUDA flags as well.
