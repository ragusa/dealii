Changed: The AffineConstraints object (formerly ConstraintMatrix) gained a
template parameter for the underlying storage type. In order to facilitate
this change, the interface for AffineConstraints has become more strict: In
particular, the AffineConstraints::distribute_local_to_global(),
AffineConstraints::add_entries_local_to_global(), and other functions now
require that all matrix and vector arguments have the same matching number
type as the AffineConstraints object.
