Changed: MatrixCreator::create_mass_matrix and
MatrixCreator::create_boundary_mass_matrix that had mixed number type (real
valued for the matrix and complex valued for vectors) have been changed to
support complex number types uniformly. This implies that now all
underlying number types of matrix, vectors and AffineConstraint objects
have to match; mixed variants are no longer supported.
