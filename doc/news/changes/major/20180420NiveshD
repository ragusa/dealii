New: The new class ColorEnriched::Helper constructs an hp::FECollection, a 
collection of finite element objects used by hp::DoFHandler, in a domain 
with multiple, possibly overlapping, sub-domains with individual
enrichment functions. Note that the overlapping regions may have
multiple enrichment functions associated with them. This is implemented
using a general constructor of FE_Enriched which allows different
enrichment functions.
