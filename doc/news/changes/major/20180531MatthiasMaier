Changed: The ConstraintMatrix class has been renamed to AffineConstraints.
Further, AffineConstraints gained a template parameter for the underlying
storage type. This in particular enables the definition of complex-valued
constraints (for example, complex-valued Dirichlet boundary conditions, or
periodic boundary conditions with an additional phase shift).
