New: FE_BernardiRaugel is the implementation of an element developed by Christine Bernardi and
Genevieve Raugel in the 1985 Mathematics of Computation paper. The Bernardi-Raugel element is an
enrichment of the P1-P0 element for Stokes problems by the addition of edge-based quadratic
bubble functions. The original description is for simplicial meshes, but this implementation is
for quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes. The BR1-P0 pair is LBB stable for Stokes problems. Due
to the edge-based bubble functions, features such as hanging nodes are not supported.
