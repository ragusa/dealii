Changed: hp::DoFHandler now automatically sets active_fe_indices
on cells that will be refined and coarsened whenever a Triangulation or
parallel::shared::Triangulation is used. Upon refinement, the
active_fe_index will be passed on to the children. For coarsening, the
parent's active_fe_index will be determined from its former children
using the FiniteElementDomination logic.
