Changed: Calling GridGenerator::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction()
and GridGenerator::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction() with values for
the coarsen and refine fractions that added to 1.0 in exact
arithmetic, but something slightly larger in floating point
arithmetic, resulted in an error. These functions are now slightly
more relaxed in that they allow arguments that add to 1.0 up to a
small floating point round off error.
