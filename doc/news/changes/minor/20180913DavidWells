Fixed: <code>make test</code> now runs in parallel automatically (i.e., it uses
a CMake command to determine the number of cores available). Since <code>make
test</code> just immediately invokes <code>ctest</code> as a subprocess, it is
currently not possible to link the number of globally available
<code>make</code> processes with the number of concurrently run tests; i.e.,
the number of cores <code>make test</code> uses is not changeable by users.
