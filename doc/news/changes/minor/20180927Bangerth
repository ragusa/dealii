Deprecated: The Threads::Mutex class is now derived from
std::mutex. As a consequence, the Threads::Mutex::ScopedLock class is
now no longer necessary and is deprecated in favor of std::lock_guard
or any of the other similar classes provided by C++11 and
later. Similarly, the Threads::Mutex::acquire() and
Threads::Mutex::release() functions are deprecated in favor of the
corresponding functions in the std::mutex base class.
